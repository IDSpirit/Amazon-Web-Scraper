# Amazon-Web-Scraper
This was a web scraper for Amazon that shows all the products on a page without sponsored links by pasting in the Amazon url. However there may be an issue in running the program as Amazon sometimes does not allow external access to scraping tools. I did not want to find a workaround as I thought it would be unethical but the program has worked on occasion.
